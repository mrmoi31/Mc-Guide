				<h2 id="Buried">Buried Treasure</h2> 
				Buried Treasure spawns in beach biomes randomly and are easiest to find using a buried treasure map which can be obtained from a shipwreck or ocean ruins. A useful thing to know is that buried treasure always spawns at chunk coordinates 9 ~ 9.
				</p>
				<h2 id="Diamonds"> Diamonds and clay linked generation?</h2>
				1. Find a clay patch that is "circular," and find the center
				<br>
				2. Move a specific amount of blocks based on the biome
				<br>
				3. Dig straight down
				<br><br>
				<strong>For the counting :</strong> if you hit the edge of a chunk while counting, go to the other side of the chunk and continue in the same direction (towards your start)
				<ul>
					<li>2 blocks south in regular lake biomes (20 - 30 tests)</li> 
					<li>2 blocks north in river biomes (5 - 7 tests)</li>
					<li>8 blocks north in swamp biomes( 10 - 11 tests)</li>
				</ul>

				<h2 id="Ancient">Ancient City</h2>
				Ancient City commonly under mountains always -52 y axis

				<h2 id="Village">Villages</h2>
				Create your own village, a door and a floor is a house
				Find one, most commons along rivers in Plains, Snowy Plains, Meadow, Desert, Savanna, Taiga or Snowy Taiga

				<h2 id="Mineshaft">Mineshafts</h2>
				Mineshafts between Y 30-50 in any biome with 4-5 chests average (but can be 0)

				<h2 id="Pyramid">Pyramid Temple</h2>
				Pyramid temple Y = 64 in desert

				<h2 id="Shipwreck">Shipwrecks/Ocean Ruins</h2>
				Shipwreck all ocean biomes, snowy beach, beach and 1-3 chests (depend the damage of the structure)<br><br>

				30% of ocean ruins generate as large ocean ruins; the other 70% generate as small ruins.<br>
				If the ocean ruin is large, there is a 90% chance for 4-8 (inclusive) small ocean ruins to generate around it in a cluster.<br>
				If the ocean ruin is warm, large ocean ruins generate with a structure integrity of 0.9 and small ocean ruins generate with a structure integrity of 0.8.<br>
				If the ocean ruin is cold, the "brick" variant of the chosen structure type generates with a structure integrity of 0.9 if large and 0.8 if small.<br>
				The "cracked" variant generates with a structure integrity of 0.7, and the "mossy" variant generates with a structure integrity of 0.5, both regardless of size. <br>
				Reduced structure integrity may also remove drowned and loot chests from the structures.<br>

				<h2 id="Spawner">Spawners</h2>
				Easiest way to exploit spawner
				<div class="center"><img src="./ressources/spawner.jpg"></div>
				
				<h2 id="Monument">Ocean Monument</h2>
				Ocean monuments generate in areas with deep ocean biome variants everywhere within a 16 block square radius around the center point, and an aquatic biome (regular/deep/frozen ocean, regular/frozen river) everywhere within a 29 block square radius around the center point. In order to prevent air pockets, water generates around the monument as a part of the structure. The four blocks in the exact middle always generate each in a different chunk. It is the largest structure that does not contain a loot chest and the largest water structure. An ocean monument can also overwrite other structures like strongholds during generation. A maximum of one ocean monument may generate in every 512×512 block area.<br>
				Ocean monuments always contain three elder guardians – one at the top and one in each wing.
				<br>
				The monument is constructed entirely from variants of prismarine and lit by sea lanterns. It includes a large central section flanked by two wings. Under the monument are 23 giant pillars that stretch to the ocean floor. The main entrance is located at the front of the central section. The base size of the structure is 58×58 blocks. Thus, the ocean monument (the location where guardians and elder guardians spawn) area is 3,364 square blocks.
				<br>
				The central section consists of various types of chambers. The chambers are randomly generated; each monument has a different number of rooms (at least six) arranged in a unique manner. The chambers connect vertically and horizontally to the different parts of the monument, including the left and right wings. At the topmost room resides an elder guardian. Around the center of the central section lies the treasure chamber, a tall room with eight blocks of gold encased in dark prismarine.
				<br>
				Occasionally, monuments contain one or more rooms with approximately 30 wet sponges on the ceiling. Sponge rooms have an opening only in the floor. Ocean monuments are not guaranteed to generate sponge rooms.
				<br>
				One of the wings contains a large room with a small pillar at the center. The room contains a second elder guardian. The other wing consists of a large open space with a large, square-shaped platform, containing another elder guardian. A long hallway that arcs around the wings and the back portion of the monument connects the two wings together.

				<h2 id="Woodland">Woodland Mansion</h2>
				A woodland mansion is a massive systematically-generated structure found in dark forests, often far away from the world spawn point. A mansion is inhabited by evokers, vindicators and allays, and is one of the only places where a totem of undying can be obtained. Besides illagers, a mansion's interior lighting is sufficiently low for other Overworld monsters to spawn. Woodland mansions can only spawn every 20,000 to 10,000 blocks. Some seeds allow mansions to spawn at 1000 - 300 blocks away (1 in 10 million chance of finding one closer than 1000 blocks) <br>
				The first floor of the mansion may only generate rooms that contain vindicators; from the second floor upward, some large rooms may contain both evokers and vindicators. Neither type of illager spawns directly in the hallways of the mansion, but they often wander into the hallways after spawning in.<br>
				A woodland mansion naturally generates vindicators, evokers, and allays inside the mansion, but because the entrance is open and most rooms in the woodland mansion are dark, Overworld monsters sometimes spawn in these rooms or come in through the entrance at night.<br>

				<h3>Diamond rooms</h3>
				A secret room with an octahedron-shaped mass of obsidian concealing a block of diamond within. These rooms can generate on any floor. <br>
				A secret room containing a lava-filled glass case supported by large obsidian foundations on the floor and ceiling. Hidden within the glass case is a block of diamond. These rooms can generate on any floor.<br>

				<h2 id="Pillager">Pillager Outpost</h2>
				Pillager outposts are semi-rare structures, generating every several hundred to couple thousand blocks. This makes them rarer than villages but less rare than woodland mansions.<br>
				Pillager outposts can generate naturally in any village-generating biome, including: Plains, Desert, Savanna, Taiga, Snowy Plains, Meadow<br>
				Also generate in the following biomes, where villages do not spawn: Grove, Snowy Slopes, Jagged Peaks, Frozen Peaks, Stony Peaks, Cherry Grove

				<h2 id="Igloo">Igloo</h2>
				You can find them in Snowy Tundras or Snowy Taigas, but you cannot find them in Ice Spikes, Snowy Mountains, or Snowy Taiga Hills. Keep your eyes peeled for an out of place rise of snow to spot igloos. Only half of them have a basement.

				<h3 id="1">1. What are bastions and how to find them?</h3>
				<p>Bastions remnants are huge structures found in the Nether, made primarily out of blackstone and blackstone bricks.<br>

				Bastions can spawn in every biome except basalt deltas.<br>

				You can fly/run around the nether randomly, but it’s not very effective – it’s dangerous, takes a lot of time and bastions are often covered in netherrack (or similar blocks), so they can be difficult to find.<br>

				<h3 id="2">2. Why bother and what is the loot?</h3>
				There are some thing that can only be found in bastion remnants, but there are also some things that bastions are (one of) the best source of.<br>
				These things are:<br>

				a) Netherite (ancient debris, netherite scraps, netherite ingots). On average, 2 ancient debris / netherite scraps per bastion.<br>

				b) Soul Speed enchantment<br>

				c) Gold. It can be used for trading/bartering, decoration or just collecting for fun. Bastions contain A LOT of gold.<br>

				d) Blackstone and its variants – blackstone, polished blackstone and blackstone bricks are great building blocks<br>

				e) Obsidian – very useful for large portals used in some farms. Crying obsidian can be used for respawn anchors and decoration<br>

				f) Bone blocks – a good source of bone meal<br>

				g) Golden carrots – one of the best kinds of food in the game<br>

				h) Enchanted diamond tools/gear<br>			

				<h3 id="3">3. Miscellaneous data</h3>

				Some Y coordinates, helpful in navigating buried bastions:<br>
				High rampart chests Y=72<br>
				Medium rampart top Y=72<br>
				Low rampart top Y=63<br>
				Treasure Room rampart chests Y=82<br>
				Treasure room main bridge Y=68<br>

				<h3 id="4">4. Bastion types – in-depth descriptions</h3>
				<h4 id="Ramparts">Ramparts</h4>

				Bridge, Hoglin Stables and Housing Units all contain two or three ramparts, that can spawn in three different variants – high, medium or low. Recognizing them can be difficult if they are buried under the netherrack and you have little idea about what you’re looking at. Just keep in mind that the high variant has a single chest and a double chest next to each other, the medium variant has a small pillar at the front and a squarish basalt pattern and the low variant has something like a line of basalt blocks in the middle.
				<br>

				<h4 id="Bridge">A. Bridge</h4>
				<h5>Overview</h5>

				Bridge is a type of bastion that is relatively quick and easy to loot. There is a very low number of chests, but a high number of gold blocks and the main gold pile is in a very accessible and safe spot. There is one chest unique to this bastion. It’s called “lodestone chest”, since it always contains a single lodestone block.
				<br>

				<h5>Loot</h5>
				Gold blocks – 16 (gold pile, guaranteed) + 1 (walkway) + 1 (lava cache) + 2 (lava passage) + 2 (lower right rampart) = 22
				<br>
				Chests – 3 generic (3 on high rampart) + 1 generic (on mid rampart) + 1 lodestone chest (guaranteed) = 5 (4 generic + 1 lodestone chest)

				<h5>Lower right rampart (1-3 gold blocks)</h5>

				Go to the right rampart, jump down its upper-left side and travel all the way down. Pass one lantern and go down the spiral path below the second lantern. There is a room with some chiseled blackstone with 1-3 gold blocks behind them.

				<h5>Lava cache (0-3 gold blocks)</h5>

				Go to the upper part of the main bridge, the end without the gold pile. Face the bastion and look to your left. There is some chiseled blackstone and up to 3 gold blocks behind the lava. Mining it is a bit tough, you should place some blocks around the gold beforehand, so it won’t burn in the lava.

				<h5>Lava passage (0-2 gold blocks)</h5>

				Jump to the lower part of the main bridge. Look for a small lava waterfall (one block wide) and block it. This will reveal a secret passage. Go three blocks down (you should have blackstone bricks at your head level and blackstone blocks at your legs level) and mine through the wall on your left. You should quickly encounter up to 2 gold blocks with some chiseled blackstone around them.

				<h4 id="Stables">B. Hoglin Stables</h4>
				<h5>Overview</h5>

				Hoglin Stables is the most varied bastion type. There are quite a lot of different possibilities in the spawning of its parts. The reward can be either amazing or absolute garbage. Also, if this bastion happens to be completely buried under the netherrack, navigation is going to be a nightmare.
				<br>

				<h5>Loot</h5>

				Gold blocks – 4 (under high rampart) + 10 (gold room) + 1 (stables floors) = 15
				<br>
				Chests – 6 generic (3 on high rampart, 2 on mid, 1 on low) + 2 generic (2x1 in fake gold rooms) + 1 generic (middle stairway, guaranteed) + 2 stables chests = 11 (9 generic + 2 stables chests)

				<h4 id="Housing">C. Housing Units</h4>

				<h5>Overview</h5>

				Housing Units is a pretty consistent type of bastion, both in layout and loot. You are guaranteed to find at least 16 gold blocks and 6 chests, but the usual amount is not much higher than that. Also, it’s pretty dangerous and tedious to loot, especially when it comes to the main area.<br>

				<h5>Loot</h5>

				Gold blocks – 12 (high rampart, guaranteed) + 4 (hidden cache, guaranteed) + 1 (wall cache, guaranteed) + 1 (housing area) = 17
				<br>
				Chests – 3 generic (on high rampart) + 1 generic (on mid rampart) + 2 generic (middle stairway, guaranteed) + 2 generic (housing area) = 8 generic

				<h4 id="Treasure">D. Treasure Room</h4>
				<h5>Overview</h5>

				The loot is excellent – huge number of gold blocks and 1-2 chests with unique, high quality loot, mainly in the form of netherite ingots.
				<br>

				<h5>Loot</h5>

				Gold blocks – 6 (2x3 in upper rampart rooms) + 2 (2x1 in rampart chest rooms, guaranteed) + 2 (main bridge, guaranteed) + 13 (double pile cache) = 23
				<br>
				Chests – 4 generic (2x2 in rampart chest rooms, guaranteed) + 3 generic (in the main area) + 1 treasure chest = 8 (7 generic + 1 treasure chest)

				<p>Shortest path : dragon spawns y=128 travel to node 1 then node 2 and then perch <br>
				Leave a node 30 blocks above or less</p>

				<h2 id="Cities">End Cities</h2>
				<p>End cities usually generate in flat areas, in "midlands" or "highlands" biomes, which are found on larger islands. One may find several cities clustered together, or travel for thousands of blocks before finding one. Unlike other structures, End cities are generated in a noticeable grid. They are located only in chunks numbered 0-8 ± a multiple of 20. 
				<br>
				For example one possible "cell" for an End city to be generated in is x_chunks=0-8 and z_chunks=80-88 which is equivalent to the coordinates x=0-128 and z=1280-1408. There can never be an End city at for example z=961-1279 or z=1409-1599 because it is outside any "cell".</p>
